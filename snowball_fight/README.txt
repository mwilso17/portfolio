This is a README for the Snowball_Fight program.

This program is ran through snowball_fight.py and was tested using VS Code

Snowball_Fight is an 2D pygame inspired by arcade styled shooters. The player
takes control of Snowman and throws snowballs at elves. The elves will try to 
tackle Snowman, turning him into just a pile of snow. 

Players can move Snowman up and down using the arrow keys on their keyboards
and can throw snowballs using the SPACEBAR. Initially, players have the ability
to throw 2 snowballs at a time (that is, 2 snowballs can be on screen at any
given time). If an elf tackles Snowman, the player will lose a life, and the 
elves will rally, becoming faster and increasing their numbers. Luckily, 
Snowman will also rally and be able to throw an additional snowball for each life
lost. For the player, the game becomes harder the fewer lives they have,
but they will be able to gain more points faster.
